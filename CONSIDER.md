# Consider

Findings from `/code-review` and `/simplify` passes that were deliberately
**skipped** rather than fixed — real observations, judged not worth acting on
immediately (too invasive for the diff at hand, out of scope, or the "fix"
wouldn't actually be simpler). Logged here instead of silently dropped so a
future pass can revisit them with fresh eyes and full context, rather than
rediscovering the same tradeoff from scratch.

Each entry: what was found, why it was skipped, and where.

## DSK Control chrome still ignores the site's light/dark theme

**Where:** `packages/lcyt-web/src/components/DskControlPage.jsx`

**Finding:** Hardcodes its entire UI chrome to a fixed dark palette via raw
hex literals (`#0d0d0d` page background, `#1e1e1e` inputs, button variants,
etc.) — ~60 occurrences, both in the ~7 shared style-constant objects
(`btnStyle`, `inputStyle`, etc.) and scattered one-off inline `style={{...}}`
props. Doesn't read `--color-*` from `shared-styles/tokens.css`, so it stays
dark regardless of the user's theme setting, unlike the rest of the app.

**Update (2026-07-06):** `DskEditorPage.jsx` (the Graphics Editor — same
pattern, same author) has been fully converted to theme tokens: all chrome
(shared style constants + inline styles) now uses `var(--color-*)`, leaving
only the actual template-content default colors (a newly-created rect's
default fill, etc. — real overlay-graphic properties, not UI) and a couple of
input placeholder-text hints untouched, since those aren't chrome. Verified
in both themes via screenshots. `DskControlPage.jsx` (the broadcast control
panel) has **not** been converted yet — same fix, same shared-style-constant
pattern, not done in this pass. Do it as a follow-up using the same approach
(map each repeated hex to the semantically-closest `--color-*` token, leaving
any genuine content-color defaults alone).

**Why skipped (DskControlPage only):** out of scope for the pass that fixed
the Editor — no reason it can't follow the exact same recipe next time.

**Fixed in the same pass:** the root cause of why *most* pages already work
was actually broken for one common case — `--color-surface`,
`--color-surface-elevated`, `--color-text-dim`, `--color-active-line`,
`--color-active-line-border`, `--color-sent-flash`, `--color-panel`, and
`--color-accent-dim` were only ever defined inside the
`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` block and the explicit
`[data-theme="dark"]`/`[data-theme="light"]` overrides — never in the
unconditional base `:root`. A user on "system" theme (the default) with
their OS in **light** mode got none of the three blocks and so got these
vars undefined. Added light-mode defaults for all eight to the base `:root`
in `packages/shared-styles/tokens.css`.

## `VariablesBus` duplicates `DskBus`'s SSE subscriber/broadcast logic

**Where:** `packages/plugins/lcyt-connectors/src/variables-bus.js` vs.
`packages/lcyt-backend/src/dsk-bus.js`

**Finding:** `VariablesBus`'s `addSubscriber`/`removeSubscriber`/
`emitVariableUpdated` (Map<apiKey, Set<Response>>, write-with-prune-on-failure
emit) is a line-for-line copy of `DskBus`'s `addDskSubscriber`/
`removeDskSubscriber`/`emitDskEvent`. `VariablesBus`'s own header comment
admits it "mirrors" `dsk-bus.js`.

**Why skipped:** `DskBus` also carries DSK-specific graphics-state fields and
is load-bearing for the DSK feature elsewhere in the app. Extracting a shared
`SseSubscriberBus` base class is the right fix, but doing it safely means
touching `dsk-bus.js` and re-verifying DSK's SSE behavior — outside the
tested surface of the connectors-plugin diff that surfaced this. Do it as its
own change with DSK regression coverage in scope, not as a side effect of an
unrelated feature branch.

## `useVariables.js` hand-rolls fetch instead of using `lib/api.js`'s `createApi()`

**Where:** `packages/lcyt-web/src/hooks/useVariables.js` (and
`packages/lcyt-web/src/components/setup-hub/ConnectorsSection.jsx`'s local
`useApi()`)

**Finding:** Both do raw `fetch(..., { headers: { Authorization: ... } })`
with manual `.ok` checking — exactly the boilerplate `lib/api.js`'s
`createApi(senderRef, backendUrlRef)` exists to eliminate, and which
`useSession.js` already uses internally.

**Why skipped:** `createApi` takes `senderRef`/`backendUrlRef` — refs
internal to `useSession`, not currently exposed on its public return value.
Wiring `useVariables`/`ConnectorsSection` through it would mean widening
`useSession`'s contract (e.g. exposing its internal `api` object), which is
consumed by many unrelated components across the app. Reasonable to do, but
as a deliberate `useSession` API change with its own review, not folded into
a feature diff that doesn't otherwise touch `useSession`'s public shape.

## `SetupHubPage`'s "Run setup wizard" link nests an `<a>` inside wouter's `<Link>`

**Where:** `packages/lcyt-web/src/components/setup-hub/SetupHubPage.jsx` —
`<Link href="/setup/wizard"><a className="btn btn--ghost btn--sm">...</a></Link>`

**Finding:** React logs a `validateDOMNesting` warning (`<a> cannot appear as
a descendant of <a>`) on every `/setup` render. The wouter version in use
already renders an `<a>` itself for `<Link>`, so wrapping a second `<a>`
inside it is the pre-v3 wouter idiom and no longer needed — `<Link
className="btn btn--ghost btn--sm">🧙 Run setup wizard</Link>` (no nested
`<a>`) is the fix.

**Why skipped:** Noticed incidentally while testing the Setup Hub card
redesign (icons/grid/dialogs); unrelated to that diff and not the only place
in the codebase that may use the older `<Link><a>` pattern — worth a repo-wide
sweep for the same idiom rather than a one-off fix here.

(Found during: Setup Hub card redesign pass, 2026-07-06.)

## `db.js`'s three `update*` functions repeat the same coalesce-with-fallback shape

**Where:** `packages/plugins/lcyt-connectors/src/db.js` — `updateConnector`,
`updateRequest`, `updateMapping`

**Finding:** All three build a `next = { col: fields.x !== undefined ? fields.x : existing.col, ... }`
object by hand, one line per column, then spell the same columns again in the
`UPDATE ... SET` string.

**Why skipped:** Checked whether a generic `coalesceFields(existing, fields, columnMap)`
helper would actually shrink this — it wouldn't. Two of the three tables need
per-field transforms that read the *existing* row, not just the incoming
value (`auth_config`/`headers` need `JSON.stringify`; `prefetch_interval_ms`/
`timeout_ms` need clamping against the existing value). A column-map generic
enough to express that ends up needing a transform function per field anyway,
which is roughly as much code as the current three explicit blocks — and
harder to read at each call site. Only 3 call sites total, which doesn't
clear the bar for an abstraction. Left as-is on purpose, not an oversight.

## New `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `caption_targets`/`translation_vendor_config`/`translation_targets` is inert — `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is never enabled

**Where:** `packages/lcyt-backend/src/db/schema.js` (the three new tables from
`plan_selfservice_config_backend.md` §1) vs. `packages/lcyt-backend/src/db/keys.js`'s
`deleteKey()` and `routes/keys.js`'s `DELETE /keys/:key?permanent=true` handler.

**Finding:** All three new tables declare `api_key TEXT ... REFERENCES api_keys(key)
ON DELETE CASCADE`, matching the same declaration already used by
`project_features`/`project_members`/`project_member_permissions`/`project_device_roles`.
But nowhere in the codebase is `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` ever issued on the
`better-sqlite3` connection (checked via grep), and SQLite disables FK
enforcement by default — so every `ON DELETE CASCADE` in this schema,
including the three new ones, is currently a no-op. `deleteKey()` is a bare
`DELETE FROM api_keys WHERE key = ?`; the permanent-delete route
(`routes/keys.js`) only manually cleans up DSK images before calling it.
Permanently deleting a project key today already leaves orphaned rows behind
in every one of those "cascading" child tables — this change adds three more
tables to that existing gap rather than introducing a new one.

**Why skipped:** Pre-existing, repo-wide gap (not specific to this diff) —
fixing it means either (a) turning on `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`, which risks
surfacing latent FK-violation errors from years of already-orphaned rows in
production-shaped databases the moment it's enabled, or (b) adding manual
`DELETE FROM <table> WHERE api_key = ?` cleanup for every child table (there
are now 7+) inside `deleteKey()`/the permanent-delete route — a real fix, but
one that touches shared deletion code far outside this plan's scope and
deserves its own audit + test pass across all affected tables, not three
lines added incidentally by a config-CRUD feature.

(Found during: `/code-review` on `claude/selfservice-config-backend-djp52h`, 2026-07-06.)
